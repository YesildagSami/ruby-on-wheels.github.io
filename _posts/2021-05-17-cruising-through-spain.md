After [spending several months in the sun on the Canary Islands]({% post_url 2021-05-09-enjoying-lanzarote_and_fuerteventura %}), the rain finally washed all the dust off my van when I arrived in [Cádiz](https://www.google.com/maps/place/C%C3%A1diz,+Spain).

The ferry ride was quite long and exhausting, so I decided to stay at the beach front of Cádiz for a couple of days to relax and hangout with one of my co-workers living in the area.

## Exploring the Spanish inland

There was no time pressure, so I cruised relaxed through the Spanish inland headed to Madrid where I wanted to meet some friends. After spending so much time at the sea, I really enjoyed [Pantano de Proserpina](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pantano+de+Proserpina/), a freshwater lake in the area of [Mérida](https://www.google.com/maps/place/06800+M%C3%A9rida,+Badajoz,+Spain).

The weather was nice and the area very quiet, so I decided to stay at the lake to work and relax.

After driving about 150km north, I settled near the convent of [Belvis De Monroy](https://www.google.com/maps/place/10394+Belv%C3%ADs+de+Monroy,+C%C3%A1ceres,+Spain).

Looking south, the elevation offered a nice view on [embalse de Valdecañas](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Embalse+de+Valdeca%C3%B1as/).

When looking west, the setting sun lightened the religious statue.

There was a spacious and quite picnic area where I worked and relaxed.

## Visiting friends in Madrid

A few days later, I arrived at the Spanish capitol where I stayed at [Casa de Campo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Casa+de+Campo,+Madrid,+Spain),

and near [Zona Verde de El Capricho](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zona+Verde+de+El+Capricho).

After spending a couple of joyful days with my friends in Madrid, I continued my journey headed to [Catalonia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Catalonia,+Spain/).
