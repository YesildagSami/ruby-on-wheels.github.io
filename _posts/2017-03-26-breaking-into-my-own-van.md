All of sudden the door to the bathroom wouldn't open any more. It appeared that the lock on the door broke. Too bad that all screws to the bathroom construction are inside. I had to disassemble the roof window to access the bathroom from the top. Obviously it's not too hard to break into a camper van. :thinking:

Once I was inside the bathroom I replaced the broken door lock with a new one that I found on eBay.

One of the brackets holding the table in the back also looked very fragile. Once I've touched it, it just fell apart:

I couldn't find a compatible replacement, so I rebuilt the bracket out of aluminum which seemed way more solid than the original plastic version.

While investigating the whole vehicle in more detail I also realized some moldy wood at the back behind the bumper. The sealing was completely gone and after removing the bumper you could see how the wood had soaked up the water over time:

I was a bit shock but luckily only the bottom part was moldy. I removed the bad parts...

... got rid of all the old glue, fixed the holes on the bottom panel and finally sealed everything with Dekalin, a sealant used by several camper manufacturers.

It started to rain the very next day and the wood behind the bumper stayed totally dry. Another fixed issue and new lessons learned about what to check when buying a used camper van! :heavy_check_mark:

I can't wait to start the work I've originally planned to do: installing the [solar system]({% post_url 2017-03-06-ordering-my-solar-system %}) and the router for the mobile internet. Once these are ready I can finally hit the road and work remotely from anywhere. :minibus: :sunny: :computer:
