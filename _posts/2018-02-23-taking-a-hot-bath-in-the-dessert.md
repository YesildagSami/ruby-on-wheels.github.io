[Hossine's village]({% post_url 2018-02-19-exploring-the-mountains %}) was nice but I was looking for something more remote to spend the work week. The hot spring near [Fask](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fask,+Morocco/) in the middle of the desert sounded like the perfect place to work in a relaxed environment. The ride off the road was quite rough and took about 30 minutes.

After crossing the broken bridge, I re-united with [Stefan and Robert]({% post_url 2018-02-04-hanging-out-with-the-mercedes-gang %}) at the hot spring.

All the effort was worth it! A company drilled for oil a couple of years ago. However, they didn't find any oil. They hit on hot water instead which has constantly bubbled out of the ground since then. Some people built a little pool around the spring where you can take a hot bath for free. Amazing!

Locals and travelers come here to take a bath or wash their clothes but also dromedaries visit the spring to enjoy a warm drink.

What a great place in the middle of the desert! :sunny:
