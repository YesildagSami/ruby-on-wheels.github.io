Today, I left three awesome guys that I met about two weeks ago. Alex, Markus and Severin, are surfer buddies from Bavaria, Germany. They've been traveling along the northern Spanish coast in their VW T4 vans. For a couple of days, we were parked next to each other at a beach near [Aviles](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aviles,+Asturias/).

While I was working, they went surfing or relaxed. In the evening, I'd join them to surf, eat dinner, drink beers and pose at the beach...

...while enjoying the beautiful sunsets:

Awesome, funny dudes that you want to be friends with! Originally, I had planned to stay for one or two more days. But I enjoyed their company so much, that I decided to stay longer. When the weather turned bad, we drove further west and ended up spending a long and fun night in [Viveiro](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Viveiro,+Lugo,+Spain).

The day after, the sun finally came back and we went surfing at [Playa de Esteiro](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+de+Esteiro/). One of the most beautiful beaches I visited in the north of Spain. A lonely bay...

...surrounded by amazing cliffs:

The perfect places to fool around with the gang. :sunglasses:

I love these guys! They'll be missed! I can't wait to see them again!
