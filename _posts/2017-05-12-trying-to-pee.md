Two-thirds on my way to Hamburg I get tired. I've already driven about 185 km since I [left]({% post_url 2017-05-11-leaving-berlin %}) Berlin at 10pm. It doesn't seem realistic to reach Hamburg  tonight. I leave the highway and drive around in the dark to find a place to sleep. Not that hard: a few minutes later I park on a [dirt road in a forest](https://goo.gl/maps/pNppiBAUVuT2) near [Neustadt-Glewe](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Neustadt-Glewe,+Germany) where I spend the first night of my trip.

Although I went to bed late I wake up early at 7am and feel rested. What a great feeling to wake up in a forest!

The trees are blocking the sun. Not ideal for my solar system. I decide to drive a bit further and stop about 80 km in front of Hamburg at a [rest stop](https://goo.gl/maps/W38z47hvdA52) near [Wittenburg](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wittenburg,+Germany/). I've seen better views but it's acceptable for my first working day in the van outside of Berlin: enough sunlight for charging the battery and free toilets close by. :+1:

After work I drive further towards Hamburg. I enjoy the relaxed ride on highway A24 while listening to music. :notes:

A view kilometers ahead of Hamburg I stop for a quick pee break and call my friend to tell her that I'll arrive very soon. Right after leaving the rest stop, a police car passes my van. They show me a sign to follow. Oh boy, let's hope everything is fine with the van! :open_mouth:

It turns out that there's no need to worry about the van. They don't care about the vehicle at all. They rather care about the suspicious tattooed driver from Berlin.

*"Are you on drugs?"*<br>
*"Uhhm, no, I just stopped working and am driving to Hamburg."*<br>
*"Ok, let's make sure you're telling the truth. Please pee into this cup!"*<br>
*"I don't know if I can pee right now. I haven't drunken much water today and I peed just three minutes ago."*<br>
*"Don't worry. You can always pee. We just need a little bit."*

So Iâ€™m holding this little plastic cup, standing right in front of my van with the cop standing right next to me, to observe what I am doing. I feel relaxed because I know there's nothing to worry about. Still I can't pee. I'm totally empty. I close my eyes and think about the sea. Still no luck.

*"Sorry, I really can't pee right now."*<br>
*"Keep on trying, we have time!"*

Fine, maybe you have time, but I don't! My friend is waiting in Hamburg. But I keep on trying. 10 minutes pass... 20 minutes pass... 30 minutes pass... 40 minutes pass. Seriously?!?

*"Sorry, it really doesn't work! Can't we take some blood or something like that?"*<br>
*"Ok, let's do some other tests."*

So we spend another 10 minutes doing some stupid exercises: standing on one foot, estimating the duration of one minute while my eyes are closed and other weird things. I'm starting to lose my patience: I'm late, my friend is waiting and I waste my time with two police officers that probably cost our state several Euros a minute. Total bullshit!

*"Hmm, ok. You can continue your ride."*<br>
*"Thank you, officer! Here is your cup."*<br>
*"Oh, you can keep it. Drive safely!"*

Finally! What a waste of time! But at least I have a new cup now. Perfect camping equipment! :satisfied:

I call my friend again and a few minutes later, we finally meet up and spend a great Friday night in Hamburg's bars. :tada: :beers:
