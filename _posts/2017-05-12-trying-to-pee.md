Two-thirds on my way to Hamburg I got tired. I  had already driven about 185 km since I [left]({% post_url 2017-05-11-leaving-berlin %}) Berlin at 10pm. It didn't seem realistic to reach Hamburg that night. So I left the highway and drove around in the dark to find a place to sleep. Not that hard: a few minutes later, I parked on a [dirt road in a forest](https://goo.gl/maps/pNppiBAUVuT2) near [Neustadt-Glewe](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Neustadt-Glewe,+Germany) where I spent the first night of my trip.

Although I had gone to bed late, I woke up early at 7am and felt rested the next day. What a great feeling to wake up in a forest!

The trees were blocking the sun. Not ideal for my solar system. I drove a bit further and stopped about 80 km in front of Hamburg at a [rest stop](https://goo.gl/maps/W38z47hvdA52) near [Wittenburg](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wittenburg,+Germany/). I've seen better views, but it was acceptable for my first working day in the van outside of Berlin: enough sunlight for charging the battery and free toilets close by. :+1:

After work I drove further towards Hamburg. I enjoyed the relaxed ride on highway A24 while listening to music. :notes:

A view kilometers ahead of Hamburg I stopped for a quick pee break and called my friend to tell her that I'd arrive very soon. Right after leaving the rest stop, a police car passed my van. They showed me a sign to follow. Oh boy, let's hope everything is fine with the van! :open_mouth:

It turned out that there was no need to worry about the van. They didn't care about the vehicle at all. They rather cared about the suspicious tattooed driver from Berlin.

*"Are you on drugs?"*<br>
*"Uhhm, no, I just stopped working and am driving to Hamburg."*<br>
*"Ok, let's make sure you're telling the truth. Please pee into this cup!"*<br>
*"I don't know if I can pee right now. I haven't drunken much water today and I peed just three minutes ago."*<br>
*"Don't worry. You can always pee. We just need a little bit."*

So I was holding this little plastic cup in front of my van, with the cop standing right next to me, to observe what I was doing. I felt relaxed because I knew there wasn't anything to worry about. Still I couldn't pee. I was totally empty. I closed my eyes and thought about the sea. Still no luck.

*"Sorry, I really can't pee right now."*<br>
*"Keep on trying, we have time!"*

Fine, maybe they had time, but I didn't! My friend was waiting in Hamburg. So I kept on trying. 10 minutes passed... 20 minutes passed... 30 minutes passed... 40 minutes passed. Seriously?!?

*"Sorry, it really doesn't work! Can't we take some blood or something like that?"*<br>
*"Ok, let's do some other tests."*

So we spent another 10 minutes doing some stupid exercises: standing on one foot, estimating the duration of one minute while my eyes were closed and other weird things. I started to lose my patience: I was late, my friend was waiting and I wasted my time with two police officers who probably cost our state several Euros a minute. Total bullshit!

*"Hmm, ok. You can continue your ride."*<br>
*"Thank you, officer! Here is your cup."*<br>
*"Oh, you can keep it. Drive safely!"*

Finally! What a waste of time! But at least I have a new cup. Perfect camping equipment! :satisfied:

I called my friend again and a few minutes later, we finally met up and spent a great Friday night in Hamburg's bars. :tada: :beers:
