In Indonesia, I fell in love with all these rich and fruity smoothies. So good. I couldn't get enough! When I came back to Spain, I immediately bought a powerful 800W blender to mix my own smoothies on the road. Since then, I've experimented with all kind of different ingredients. Here is a small selection of all these delicious and healthy drinks.

## The orange sunrise

A light and fresh drink to start the day. Rich in vitamin C:

- apple
- carrots
- kiwi
- lemon
- olive oil
- chia seeds
- orange juice (with pulp)

## Red sunrise

A slightly softer alternative to the orange sunrise:

- strawberries
- banana
- cinnamon
- chia seeds
- walnuts
- apple juice

## Green sunshine

A perfect drink in the afternoon to get refreshed:

- avocado
- broccoli
- spinach
- cucumber
- kiwi
- lemon
- ginger
- olive oil
- orange juice (with pulp)

## The brown knockout

Definitely delicious but probably not that healthy. After enjoying the brown knockout, you might want to take a little siesta and digest: :wink:

- banana
- dates
- almond milk
- regular milk
- cinnamon
- cacao
- walnuts

## And maaany more

The list could be endless: Mango lassi, liquid muesli, a mix of vegetables, ... I've tried a lot and almost everything was really delicious.

The blender was definitely a great investment! In case I will ever get tired of software development, I might start selling fresh and healthy smoothies to hungry surfers! Right at the beach! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
