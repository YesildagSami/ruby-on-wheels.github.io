While [rebuilding the brake system of my van]({% post_url 2020-06-11-rebuilding-the-brake-system %}) at the farm of my friends, they were shooting a music video for their band called the [Drunken Dentists](https://www.facebook.com/TheDrunkenDentists/). The first scenes were shot in the barn.

Once the brakes were fixed, we left the barn and shot a few more scenes outside.

The shooting was a lot of fun! I really like the clip for their brand new song "Bunter Affe". Check it out on YouTube:
