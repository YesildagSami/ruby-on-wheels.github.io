After [installing]({% post_url 2018-10-05-resisting-colder-temperatures %}) the diesel heater, the weather  surprisingly changed again. The warm and sunny evenings were perfect to renew the perforated floor.

It was about time to remove the original vinyl flooring that didn't look great anymore. Except for a few holes that were easy to fix, the wooden panel below the broken vinyl seemed to be in good condition.

There was no need for replacing it. I could directly put a layer of the [remaining insulator]({% post_url 2018-09-23-insulating-my-van %}) on the wooden floor.

To avoid sinking into the soft insulator while walking on the floor, I trimmed a 9mm textured coated board that would evenly distribute the load.

The solid board nicely fitted on top of the insulator and didn't sag under load.

For further comfort and a better look, I added another thin layer of vinyl flooring on top of the hard panel.

The additional layers raised the floor by acceptable 2,1 cm. I could definitely feel a difference during cold nights. The new floor has also reduced the noise while driving the van. It was worth it! :ok_hand:
