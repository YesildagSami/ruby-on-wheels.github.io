Insulating a camper van is essential to keep the temperature balanced on hot and cold days. A proper insulation is also important to prevent rust and mold in the van. Most of the rust that I [removed]({% post_url 2018-09-05-moving-into-an-old-military-ambulance %}) during the summer wasn't caused by rain water. The rust in the gutter and roof was a result of condensed water that accumulated inside the van.

## Preparing the body

The original ambulance was partly insulated with glass wool that was glued on the body parts that were easy to access.

Equipped with a scraper, acetone and gasoline, I spent a couple of hot days in my chemical sauna removing all the nasty glass wool and glue.

I also got rid of all the heavy girders that had been welded into the van to hold the beds and other equipment of the former ambulance.

## Applying the insulator

After removing some remaining rusty spots, refreshing the paint were the old paint didn't look well anymore and cleaning everything with acetone, I applied [19mm self-adhesive insulator](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00EZUW81U?tag=mumothhoofba-21) to the walls and the ceiling.

Applying the insulator in every nook and corner was quite elaborate and took me a few days.

## Building the scaffold for the cladding

I'm planning to cover the walls and the ceiling with wood. I built a wooden scaffold to avoid thermal bridges between the body and the air inside the van when mounting the cladding.

Slightly squeezed into the insulated roof, the wooden arches offer a surface to install the ceiling without putting screws into the body.

Similarly, I mounted slats on the horizontal pillars that will allow me to mount the walls and furnitures without creating thermal bridges.

## Finalizing the insulation

I decided to squeeze polystyrene into the remaining hollow areas between the slats and the horizontal pillars. The hard panels should further improve the insulation and prevent the self-adhesive mats from coming off.

I'm almost done with insulating the van. I could definitely feel a difference while the cold and rainy weather came over Berlin to announce autumn. :maple_leaf:

I can't wait for the next milestone! :tada:
