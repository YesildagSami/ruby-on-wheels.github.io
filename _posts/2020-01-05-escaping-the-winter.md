Since [installing the wood stove]({% post_url 2019-12-02-installing-a-wood-stove %}), I've experienced temperatures far below the freezing point. While the whole van was covered with frost outside, it was comfortably warm inside.

Nevertheless, I prefer the long and sunny days in the south. After spending the Christmas holidays and New Year's Eve with my family and friends, I hit the road headed south.

## Leaving Germany

I spent my last night in Germany near [Freiburg](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Freiburg+im+Breisgau/) at a spot where I previously stayed. Unfortunately, camper vans didn't seem to be welcome anymore. The spot where I parked my [Mercedes 209D]({% post_url 2017-01-11-my-future-mobile-office %}) two years ago was blocked by huge trunks.

Luckily, I found a calm spot nearby where I woke up early in the morning to approach the French border.

## Passing France

The weather wasn't much better in France: cold and rainy. After passing [Lyon](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lyon,+France/@45.7579341,4.7650814,12z/) in the afternoon, I was able to spot the blue sky more often. It was still quite cold, though.

The further I drove south, the better the weather became. When I finally approached the Mediterranean Sea in the evening, I could enjoy a beautiful sunset.

I had reached my destination for the day and slept right behind the dunes next to a calm side road near [Frontignan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/34110+Frontignan,+France/).

Although the evening was really nice, I fired my stove as it became quite chill after the sunset.

## Approaching Spain

After strolling along the beach of Frontignan in the morning, I hit the road again headed further south towards the Spanish border.

I was finally able to drive with an open window again. :tada: The German winter was completely out of my mind when I took a little break next to palm trees at [Pineda de Mar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/08397+Pineda+de+Mar,+Barcelona,+Spain/).
