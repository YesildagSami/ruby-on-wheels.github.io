Today, I checked out my future mobile office near [DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany](https://www.google.com/maps/place/D%C3%BCsseldorf,+Germany/@51.2385861,6.6742667,11z): A Mercedes-Benz 209D from 1984.

It's fully equipped with a small kitchen (fridge, stove and sink),

a table with two benches on the left and right that can be transformed into a bed,

and a bathroom with a foldable sink and a chemical toilet.

The transporter was originally a 207D with the OM 616 engine. However the four cylinder engine got replaced by a OM 617 engine. So now the van is operated with five cylinders and is technically equivalent to a 209D.

Overall the camper van seemed to be in good condition for its age. A little rust, the engine started and ran smoothly and there was no musty smell inside. Of course it's an old camper van that will need some TLC and I'm quite sure once I start working on it I'll encounter a lot of hidden issues.

I immediately had fallen in love with the van and made the deal! :tada:

The current owner imported the van from Netherlands but he never registered the vehicle in Germany. So he'll organize all required paper work and in a few weeks I'll register the van and drive it to Berlin!
