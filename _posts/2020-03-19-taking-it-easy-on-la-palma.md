Inspired by the awesome hiking trip on [La Gomera]({% post_url 2020-03-09-learning-to-appreciate-la-gomera %}), I drove right into [Parque Nacional de la Caldera de Taburiente](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caldera+de+Taburiente+National+Park/) after arriving on La Palma. I wanted to hike on [Roque de los Muchachos](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Roque+de+los+Muchachos/), La Palma's highest peak. I followed the curvy road LP-4 and parked my van near [Mirador de Los Andenes](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mirador+de+Los+Andenes/).

The hiking trail along the steep hillside provided a nice view into the valley.

After passing Pico Fuente Nueva 2366 meters above sea level, I reached Roque de los Muchachos which is 2423 meters above sea level.

Although it was a little cloudy, I was able to see the top of the [Teide](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mount+Teide/) volcano on Tenerife.

The altitude had a noticeable impact on the temperature. It was quite cold when I came back to my van. I didn't feel like spending the night up there and further followed road LP-4.

## Working from the forest

Several peaceful places invited me for little breaks on my way through the forest toward the coast.

I met two older locals at one of these spots. They seemed very nice and relaxed. Despite my poor Spanish skills, we managed to talk about our work, hobbies and the beauty of their island. I really liked the spot.

After all the driving on [La Gomera]({% post_url 2020-03-09-learning-to-appreciate-la-gomera %}), I felt like settling for a couple of days. Equipped with a little spring the spot seemed like a perfect place to work and relax.

Unfortunately, the trees covered the sun during the day. After two work days and extensive cooking sessions with my [electric cooker]({% post_url 2018-09-18-testing-my-new-equipment %}#electric-cooker), I had to look for a place that was more sunny.

## Relaxing at Piscinas de La Fajana

I followed road LP-1 toward the coast. After enjoying the nice view to the ocean for a couple of kilometers,

![View on the northern coast of La Palma](/assets/images/IMG_7532.jpg)

I reached the natural pool of [La Fajana](https://www.google.com/maps/place/38726+La+Fajana,+Santa+Cruz+de+Tenerife/). I'm repeating myself, but I really love these natural pools that you can find all over the Canary Islands! :wink:

I met a German couple from Munich who had spent several days in their van in front of the pool. I really enjoyed their company and the spot, so I spent the rest of the week working and relaxing at La Fajana before taking the ferry back to Tenerife to finally ascend Pico del Teide! :volcano:
