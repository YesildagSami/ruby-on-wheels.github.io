The restrictions in Spain didn't seem very promising. Especially for non-residents like Marco and me. After [staying a couple of weeks in our vans in a parking lot on Lanzarote]({% post_url 2020-03-24-experiencing-the-spanish-lockdown-in-a-van %}), we decided trying to get back to our home countries. We boarded the ferry from [Arrecife](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Arrecife,+Las+Palmas,+Spain/) to [Cádiz](https://www.google.com/maps/place/C%C3%A1diz,+Spain/) on a Sunday night at 1am.

## Crossing the Atlantic

Marco was lucky and could park his smaller Volkswagen T3 on deck, so he could sleep and relax in his van isolated from the other passengers. I was told to park my truck under deck, so I couldn't access it during the ferry ride. I didn't feel like staying with the other passengers in the public seating areas, so I slept outside in a quite corner on deck.

The air was a little cold at night but quickly warmed up in the morning when the sun was shining.

## Dropping Marco at the airport

After a calm but boring ferry ride of 34 hours, we finally arrived in Cádiz. Marco's engine sounded really bad. Probably a worn out bearing. He had already booked an appointment at a [garage specialized in Volkswagen vans](http://www.karvans.com/) near [Sevilla](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Seville,+Spain/). However, the radiator was additionally leaking a lot of coolant, so there was no point in driving the van from Cádiz to Sevilla.

While Marco's van got towed to the garage, I drove him to the airport of Sevilla where he booked a couple of flights back to Denmark. Eventually, he'll come back to Spain to pick up his van and hopefully continue his [surf trip](https://marcos-surf-journal.github.io/). :pray:

## Crossing Spain

After dropping Marco at the airport I started my trip headed to Germany.

Expect for a small number trucks, the highway was completely empty. Several signs stated that only authorized trips were allowed.

In the afternoon the weather changed and it was raining a lot.

I spent the whole day driving until it turned dark.

I stopped at a [gas station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Estaci%C3%B3n+de+servicio+Cepsa/) 200km in front of [Valencia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Valencia,+Spain/) and felt quite tired, so I decided to spend the night there.

When I continued my journey early in the morning, the weather was even worse than the day before.

After driving through heavy rain on empty highways for several hours, I approached the French border.

## Crossing France

To my surprise, there weren't any border patrols. I could tell that the French restrictions were less strict than in Spain. Although the French highways were empty, too, I regularly saw people cycling or running on paths and roads next to the highway. These outdoor activities were explicitly prohibited in Spain. Seeing these people outside made me feel a little more "normal", although I was still driving alone on a highway with 5 tracks.

I kept driving until night again and spent my second night at a [highway stop](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Station+De+Service+Eni+%2B+Brioche+Dor%C3%A9e/) in front of [Valence](https://www.google.com/maps/place/26000+Valence,+France/). After driving for almost 14 hours, I felt asleep immediately.

## Crossing the German boarder

I continued my journey early in the morning and drove the last 600km through France until I reached the German border. This time, there was a border patrol. I was stuck between several trucks and had to wait for about an hour until I was finally on German territory again. :tada:

To my surprise there were a lot of passenger cars driving on the highway. The German restrictions seemed way more relaxed than in Spain.

## Arriving at my friends farm

Headed to the farm of my friends, I still had 500km in front of me after passing the German boarder in the afternoon. I was still driving when it was dark.

![Driving in the darkness](/assets/images/IMG_7821.jpg)

Around 10pm I reached the farm. While my [trip to the Canaries in January]({% post_url 2020-01-26-crossing-spain %}) took me a month, I nailed the 2600km in only two and a half days on my way back. I was exhausted but happy. I finally arrived at a safe spot where I can freely and indefinitely stay with my van until the global situation will become better again. :pray:
