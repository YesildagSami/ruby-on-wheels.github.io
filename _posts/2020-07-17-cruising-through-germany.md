After staying in my van on the farm of my friends for about two months, the Corona restrictions were loosened in Germany. My van had a  [brand new brake system]({% post_url 2020-06-11-rebuilding-the-brake-system %}) and I was finally able to hit the road again to see my family and friends living all across the country.

## Visiting friends around Dresden

On my way to Berlin, I stopped in Dresden to visit some friends. I found a few good spots in the city, but I really enjoyed staying outside the city:

On the weekend, my friends and I went on a little trip into [Saxon Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Saxon+Switzerland+National+Park), a beautiful national park with lots of trails.

We enjoyed nice hikes and cozy dinners in my van.

One of the highlights of my trip through [Saxony](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Saxony,+Germany/) was visiting a community living in tiny houses, trailers, trucks on farm near [Bischofswerda](https://www.google.com/maps/place/01877+Bischofswerda,+Germany/). I really enjoyed the vibe. Good times!

## Coming back to Berlin

Coming back to Berlin always feels great. Especially in the summer.

Although I [left Berlin]({% post_url 2017-05-11-leaving-berlin %}) more than three years ago, I still feel very connected to Germany's biggest city and all my friends living there. As usual, I stayed with my van in my old neighborhood near [Tempelhofer Feld](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tempelhofer+Feld/) and enjoyed good company.

I also left the city once in a while to relax a little bit at the nice lakes around Berlin.

## Cruising through southern Germany

After spending a great time in Berlin, I drove back to southern Germany where I spend time with all my friends across different places:

The farm near [Dorfen](https://www.google.com/maps/place/84405+Dorfen,+Germany/), east of Munich,

the [Inn river](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Inn/) near [Rosenheim](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rosenheim,+Germany/)

and of course the [Allg√§u](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Allg%C3%A4u/), the place where I went to school.

Part of my family still lives there, so that's probably the area I consider as "home".

There are so many beautiful places in Germany, so I really didn't mind the travel restrictions for foreign countries. Good times!
