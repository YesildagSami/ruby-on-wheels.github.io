I started my first workweek in Morocco on a [campsite](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Laguna+Park/) in [Oualidia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oualidia,+Morocco/). The new SIM-card from [Maroc Telecom](https://www.iam.ma) worked like a charm. The connection was fast and reliable all day. Perfect! Knowing that my mobile office was fully operational in Morocco, too, I felt more relaxed and could enjoy the sunset after my first successful workday in Africa.

## Heading further down south

I followed the coastal road headed towards the warmer south. I found a quiet spot to work on a side road near [Plage Lalla Fatna](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Plage+Lalla+Fatna/).

My mobile office offered a fantastic view over the beach.

Even the internet connection in this remote area was perfect.

David and Maria joined me in the evening. I met them the day before in Oualidia. They are also from Berlin and travel for one year in their yellow Mercedes-Benz 100D van. We drove down to the beach where we parked our vans next to each other.

We made several delicious pizzas in my van and spent a great evening together.

## Taking a little detour to Marrakech

David and Maria told me about their plan to visit Marrakech. I heard great things about the former imperial city in the heart of Morocco. So, I decided to join them and checkout Marrakech over the weekend.

The way to Marrakech was visually boring and exhausting to drive. It was very foggy and most drivers didn't turn on their lights.

I had to pull my van off the road two times to avoid frontally crashing into trucks that passed other vehicles in the fog. :anguished: Fortunately, I made it to Marrakech without further issues where I reunited with David and Maria on a [campsite](https://www.google.com/maps/place/31°42'26.4"N+7°59'20.1"W/).

## Diving into the medina of Marrakech

On the weekend, the weather was perfect to explore the center of Marrakech. We dived into tiny and winding alleys right after passing the walls surrounding the medina.

They were full of goods,

food and people.

This little friend actually managed to find a quiet spot in this lively chaos.

In contrast to the busy streets, the rooftops were calm areas to relax. We had a nice view over the city from one of the terraces.

The High Atlas mountain range was clearly visible in the back. Some people were probably snowboarding 50km away from us while we were enjoying the sun in our T-shirts. Fascinating contrast.

## Enjoying the Moroccan food

I tried all kind of different tajines, a dish that is cooked and severed in an earthenware pot. My favorite was a lamb tajine cooked with plums, raisins and other delicious ingredients.

It was very interesting to see all restaurants serving food that was made out of ingredients available on the markets around the corner. Unpacked, fresh local food. Delicious!

## Driving back to the coast

Marrakech was awesome. However, all the turmoil can be a little exhausting. It was time to drive back to the coast and continue my trip down south. I left Marrakech on Sunday morning headed to Essaouira. There was no fog this time. Just the sun, the blue sky and the dessert.

Compared to the rainy beginning on my first weekend, this felt and looked more like Africa. :sunny: :sunglasses:

In the afternoon, I arrived at [Essaouira](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Essaouira,+Morocco/) and explored the beautiful harbor city with my bicycle.

I met a dutch couple in the parking lot with a beautiful Mercedes-Benz 609D. While we were hanging out and talking, a guy came by to park his special "vehicles" next to our vans.

I was obviously not in Europe any more... :camel:
