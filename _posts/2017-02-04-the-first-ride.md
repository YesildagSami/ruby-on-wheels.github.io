On my way back from the [Git Merge](https://git-merge.com/) conference in Brussels, I picked up the camper van near D체sseldorf.

My first ride started with 188,987 km on the odometer.

Google told me that I should make the 566 km to Berlin within five hours.

However with 88 horsepowers, 2.6 tons and a straight windshield, you can't take advantage of the German highways without speed limits. I was mostly cruising behind trucks with an average speed of 85 to 90 km/h. :wink:

Driving the van felt really awesome: a lot of space, a comfortable seat high up, the sound of the diesel engine, the huge steering wheel and the simple instruments. It's everything you need for a relaxed ride. This is totally the right vehicle for me! :+1: :heart:

Apparently Google was wrong. With 85 km/h you can't make 566 km in five hours. After about 300 km it was already dark, so I decided to spend my first night in the van.

During February it's still cold in Germany: -2째C (~ 28째F). Time to test the heating, my sleeping bag and the mobile SIM-card to watch movie on Netflix.

What a great feeling, I can sleep wherever I stop. My bed is always with me!

Another 250 km the next day and the van was finally in Berlin! :tada:

On average I burn about 13 liters of diesel for 100 km (~ 18 mpg). Compared to what I read online, this seems to be an acceptable consumption. I also noticed that the timing of the automatic transmission is not perfect. The first hidden issue to investigate! :wrench:

I can't wait to start working on the van once I'm back from my trip to [Mexico](http://sayulitacowork.com/)!
