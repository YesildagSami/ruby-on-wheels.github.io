It felt great to come back to Lanzarote which I had to [hastily leave during the first lockdown]({% post_url 2020-03-24-experiencing-the-spanish-lockdown-in-a-van %}) in 2020. After [spending Christmas on the mainland with great company]({% post_url 2020-12-30-celebrating-christmas-on-the-beach %}), I mostly spent my first week on Lanzarote by myself. I really enjoyed working and relaxing next to a natural pool south of [Arrieta](https://www.google.com/maps/place/35542+Arrieta,+Lanzarote,+Las+Palmas,+Spain/).

In my free time, I went swimming and explored the mountains with my bike.

It rained more often than it did during my previous visits which had a visible impact on the island.

Gras, flowers, trees and other plants were growing everywhere.

## Enjoying the time with friends

I took the ferry from Lanzarote to Fuerteventura in mid-January to meet up with two friends from the [farm in Bavaria]({% post_url 2018-11-29-looking-for-shelter-in-bavaria %}). We parked our vans on the cliffs in front of [Playa El Aljibe de la Cueva](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+El+Aljibe+de+la+Cueva/). It didn't take much time until our small camp grew by a few more friends joining the crew.

The cliffs became our home-base. My friends regularly went on small excursions during the week, while I mostly stayed on the cliffs to work.

On the weekends I was able to join my friends' vacation life: Surfing,

mountain-biking,

swimming in calm bays,

or having BBQs on the beach.

The weekly [Gofio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gofio)-pancake sessions became one of my personal highlights. Every Saturday morning, I prepared pancakes and invited the gang for a sociable breakfast.

Although we spent most of our time near Playa El Aljibe de la Cueva, we regularly stayed a couple of days at other places like [Playa de Sotavento de Jand√≠a](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+de+Sotavento+de+Jand%C3%ADa/) where my [friend](https://www.polarsteps.com/vanmantraveler) took this amazing photo of our vans and the stars,

[La Pared](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+La+Pared/),

or [Playa de Vigocho](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+de+Vigocho),

where my [friend](https://www.polarsteps.com/vanmantraveler) took great pictures of the cliff, the beach and our vans with his drone,

before we enjoyed yet another stunning sunset.

Although everyone had their own schedules and activities, we usually spent the evenings together having dinner, playing the guitar and drinking some beers. Time flew and the group seemed to grow together like a family. I really enjoyed our everyday life on the island. Everyone seemed to get along with each other, so the vibe in our group was really nice. I felt productive at work and relaxed at the same time while being surrounded by friends enjoying their vacation.

I couldn't have imagined a better start into the new year! Great times!
