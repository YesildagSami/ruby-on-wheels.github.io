We broke up our [Mercedes gang]({% post_url 2018-02-04-hanging-out-with-the-mercedes-gang %}) last Friday after spending two and a half weeks at the cliffs north of [Aghroude](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aghroude,+Morocco/). I only drove a few kilometers down south and spent the night at [Plage Aourir](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Plage+Aourir/) where I enjoyed a beautiful sunset over the ocean.

## Driving into the mountains

My teammates took off Monday, the President's day which is a holiday in the US. I used the long weekend to explore the Anti Atlas mountain range. The scenery completely changed after driving a couple of hours east into the mountains.

I passed a local walking next to the road in the middle of nowhere. The next village was at least 25km away. I stopped and asked him if he wanted to get a ride. Sadik happily accepted my offer. He lived in a tiny village up the mountains and was on his way to [Tafraoute](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tafraoute,+Morocco/) to re-new his insurance for his motorbike. Other travelers had recommended to visit Tafraoute. I decided to bring Sadik to his destination. Win-win! :wink:

I dropped Sadik in the center of the town and drove a few kilometers further into a wide area surrounded by mountains.

I spotted a beautiful old firetruck next to a 4x4 Mercedes T1 while exploring the area.

Fritz and Jule from Germany came here with their Mercedes 711 truck built in 1966. They traveled together with Dominic and Debbi from Switzerland. Dominic was replacing the rear wheel bearing of their 4x4 310D when I came to meet the group.

Awesome! I found a new Mercedes gang. Although my camper van didn't really fit into the fleet of off-road vehicles, I was allowed to join the group. :wink:

The area around us was completely quite. No buildings, no cars, no waves. I woke up well rested on Sunday morning. The rising sun warmed up our little camp while I enjoyed my breakfast.

## Taking my bike for a long ride

Since visiting Asturias in Spain last summer, I haven't taken my mountain bike for a ride. The weather was perfect and the wide and rocky landscape seemed like a paradise for mountain-biking.

Riding cross-country through the rocky desert was so much fun. I spotted Tafraoute in a valley ahead of me.

The downhill ride to Tafraoute was quite technical. A lot of big rocks, not as flowy as the ride before. Nevertheless, I had a lot of fun making my way down to Tafraoute where I took a little break at this old house or ruin?

## Meeting Hossine

I met Hossine when I was about to leave our little Mercedes camp on Monday. He lives in [Abaynou](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Abaynou,+Morocco/), a small village near [Guelmim](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Guelmim+81000,+Morocco/). He came to Tafraoute with some other travelers and had to go back to his village for work. So, I had new passenger and destination. No need for any plans! :sunglasses:

The long drive with Hossine was relaxed and enjoyable. I got along with him really well. We arrived at his village in the evening where I parked my van in a quiet spot between the oasis and the houses.

He invited me to his family's house where we drank a lot of tea, ate a delicious dinner and hold interesting conversations.

## Enjoying a hot bath in the middle of the desert

Hossine's village was nice but I was looking for something more remote to spend the work week. The hot spring near [Fask](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fask,+Morocco/) in the middle of the desert sounded like the perfect place to work in a relaxed environment. The ride off the road was quite rough and took about 30 minutes.

After crossing the broken bridge, I re-united with [Stefan and Robert]({% post_url 2018-02-04-hanging-out-with-the-mercedes-gang %}) at the hot spring.

All the effort was worth it! A company drilled for oil a couple of years ago. However, they didn't find any oil. They hit on hot water instead which has constantly bubbled out of the ground since then. Some people built a little pool around the spring where you can take a hot bath for free. Amazing!

Locals and travelers come here to take a bath or wash their clothes but also dromedaries visit the spring to enjoy a warm drink.

What a great place in the middle of the desert! :sunny:
