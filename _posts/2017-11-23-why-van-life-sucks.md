Most of the people living a "normal" life are concerned about the lack of comfort: What do I do when I have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night? Where do I take a shower? Am I freezing in the winter? Where do I do my laundry? Is the van too small for me?

Interestingly, I've never experienced any of these issues. If I need something, I just build it into my van. If it's cold or rainy, I just move to another place where the sun is shining. My vehicle offers all I need for a good life. I feel very, very comfortable living there. I even missed my van while staying in hotels during my [vacation in Indonesia]({% post_url 2017-11-21-taking-a-vaction-from-van-life %}). :wink:

## Not welcome

I mostly deal with issues that are unrelated to comfort. When you live in a camper van, it's harder to be part of society. Van life is not considered "normal": street signs, barriers in front of parking lots, local residents or the police explicitly tell you that you're not welcome.

Over the time, I got used to be abnormal. I'm ok with changing locations often and avoiding certain areas that are van-unfriendly. However sometimes, it'd be great to feel less guilty and more accepted when sleeping in public parking lots or washing my body in public toilets. What's so wrong about that? Bathrooms were built to be used, weren't they?

I can understand why people dislike vans and their owners: Parking lots full of vehicles that ruin the atmosphere. Garbage and toilet paper all over the bushes. I hate that, too! When I visit a place, I keep it clean and stay quiet. I act responsible and try to integrate.

These hotspots probably evolve because camper vans are banned from so many places. A lot of van owners use apps and online communities to share van-friendly spots. Good and bad at the same time: it's easier to find spots but it also results in congestion and attracts people who don't act responsible. Some of them consider public parking lots as campsites to spend their vacation. :thumbsdown:

A parking lot is not a campsite. It's just a place to park your vehicle. That's it! Put your camping chairs into a park nearby! Walk to the next public toilet instead of taking a shit in the bushes next to your van! If it can't be avoided, dig a hole, bury your :shit: and please, don't leave your toilet paper there!

Dispose your garbage in dedicated trash bins! Walk to the next bin, if the one close to the parking lot is almost full! If you need more comfort, then visit an actual campsite! Don't let the locals suffer from your laziness! Simple but efficient rules that might help to make vans more welcome? :thinking:

## Being a rambler

Currently, only a few people can or want to live nomadically. On my trip, I met a lot of people. Most of them are awesome and I wished they would have stayed longer with me. But they had to go back to their homes to continue their job, studies or take care of their family. It's definitely harder to build up and maintain long-term friendships and relationships when you live on the road. Moving around allows me to hangout with all these great people. At the same time, I have to say "goodbye" more often. :wave::cry:

Before living in a van, I worked remotely from different places around the world and traveled by airplane. Back then, I experienced similar problems. Maybe these challenges are rather related to steady travels than van life? Admittedly, chances are high that you travel more often, when you live in a rolling "home". :wink:

Right now, I totally enjoy traveling. There are still a lot of places that I want to visit. Who knows, maybe one day, I settle in a nice place and go on smaller trips once in awhile? Everything is possible! :crystal_ball:

Do you live in a van? What are you struggling with?
