My [weekend trip through France]({% post_url 2020-01-05-escaping-the-winter %}) ended on a Sunday evening in a calm parking lot at the outskirts of Barcelona.

The area was perfect to spend a couple of days in Barcelona.

It was quiet and sunny while I was working during the day,

yet close enough to reach the city center in 15 minutes by bike to meet friends and go to concerts in the evenings.

I really liked Barcelona. Although I was mostly working during the week, I was able to meet a few co-workers and friends living in the area of Barcelona. When I didn't meet someone for lunch, I often walked up the hill behind the parking lot that offered a nice view over the city.

During the weekends, there was more time to go out with my friends :beers: or cycle along the coast.

We also tried to go surfing in [Masnou](https://www.google.com/maps/place/El+Masnou,+Barcelona/). Unfortunately, the waves weren't as high as forecasted, so we just ended up spending a relaxed evening at the coast.

## Approaching Madrid

After spending two sunny weeks with my friends in Barcelona, I left the Catalan capital on a Saturday morning headed to Madrid to visit more friends.
Probably attracted by the striking name of the coastal town, I stopped in [Peñíscola](https://www.google.com/maps/place/12598+Peniscola,+Castell%C3%B3n/) for a lunch break and refueling.

The old fortified seaport looked really nice.

I spent a little time exploring its narrow alleys,

before hitting the road again headed to Valencia.

The scenery on my way to Valencia was very monotonous: ugly hotel complexes along the coast to the left,

and orange plantations to the right.

I didn't feel like spending much more time in this area and wanted to see my friends in Madrid. Although the weather didn't look great, I left Valencia behind and drove right into the rugged mountain chains of the [Sistema Ibérico](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Iberian+System/).

It was slightly snowing when I arrived on a mountain near [Cuenca](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cuenca/) 1080 meters above sea level. The lights of Cuenca created a mysterious atmosphere.

I had a nice view over the canon and the city when I woke up the next day.

Cuenca seemed like a nice city. Several buildings were built right next to the rim of the canon.

As the weather was cold and rainy, I didn't spent much time in Cuenca and drove towards Madrid after breakfast.

## Visiting Madrid

It was great to visit Madrid with a van again. I parked my van in parking lots at Casa de Campo like I did more than [two years ago]({% post_url 2017-10-29-van-life-in-a-big-city %}). Everything felt familiar.

Although it was raining most of the time, I spent a great week with all my friends from Madrid that I haven't seen for awhile. Good times! :beers: :tada:

## Leaving the Spanish mainland

I enjoyed the time in Madrid a lot, but the weather wasn't joyful at all. So, I left the Spanish capital headed south to the Atlantic ocean.

Expect for a short stop at a gas station I spent a whole day driving from Madrid to [Huelva](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Huelva/@37.2708666,-6.9571999,14z/) where the weather wasn't much better.

![Harbor of Huelva in the rain](/assets/images/IMG_6819.jpg)

I found a calm parking lot in front of the [José Celestino Mutis Botanical Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/bot%C3%A1nico+Jos%C3%A9+Celestino+Mutis+Park/) where I ordered a ferry ticket to [Lanzarote](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lanzarote/@28.9712389,-13.6973394,11z/), one of Spain’s Canary Islands.

I boarded the ferry in the next morning.

I was ready for Spain's sunny islands located in the West of Africa! :sunny: :palm_tree: :volcano:
