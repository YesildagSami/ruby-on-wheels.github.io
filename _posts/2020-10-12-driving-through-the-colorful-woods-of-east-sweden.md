After [building our little wooden shack in the woods]({% post_url 2020-09-21-enjoying-autmun-at-the-gulf-of-bothnia %}), we stopped in [Örnsköldsvik](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%C3%96rnsk%C3%B6ldsvik,+Sweden/) for grocery shopping and grabbing a bite. We hadn't visited any cities in several weeks, so we parked our vans near the harbor to stroll around the city center.

We drove back into the countryside headed south as we didn't feel like spending much time in the populated area. At a small lake called [Mäjasjön](https://www.google.com/maps/place/M%C3%A4jasj%C3%B6n/@63.0266445,18.2241263,17z/), we found a spring to fill up our water tanks. The area was very calm and the autumnal weather seemed perfect for spending a cozy afternoon in my heated van watching documentaries about building log houses.

After a relaxed stay at Mäjasjön we drove to the bay near [Häggnor](https://www.google.com/maps/place/870+30+H%C3%A4ggnor,+Sweden/) where we enjoyed a beautiful sunset.

I was on-call and wasn't able to drive long distances, so we decided to stay for a couple of days in the beautiful bay.

## Fog and drizzly weather

There were only a few clouds in the sky when we arrived at a small lake west of [Brunne](https://www.google.com/maps/place/871+92+Brunne,+Sweden/) called Fällbodtjärner.

The weather completely changed over night. The lake was covered in fog when we went on a short hike during my lunch break.

The colorful leaves on the ground nicely stood out of the dense fog.

The drizzly weather create a mystical atmosphere when driving through the woods in the evening.

## Seeing the sun again

After spending a couple of days in the fog, I felt revived when observing the sunrise at [Orrsjön](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Orrsj%C3%B6n/@62.1950712,17.2897931,960m/), a small lake near [Torrsjö](https://www.google.com/maps/place/862+95+Torrsj%C3%B6,+Sweden/). The rising sun nicely shined on the colorful leaves and created a stunning autumn atmosphere.

While I was working in my mobile office, Moritz relaxed at the lake fishing and reading a book.

The weather was still nice when we arrived at [Åsbölesjön](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%C3%85sb%C3%B6lesj%C3%B6n/), a small lake west of [Morängsviken](https://www.google.com/maps/place/820+74+Mor%C3%A4ngsviken,+Sweden/).

The area was mostly overgrown and inaccessible for our vans. Luckily, we managed to find a tiny spot next to the dirt road leading to the lake where we could park our vans.

Yet another great place to enjoy the sunset.

## Experiencing changeable weather

The scenery at Torrsjö completely changed over night. There was a strong wind and it rained a lot when we woke up.

![Rainy weather at Torrsjö](/assets/images/IMG_0106.jpg)

We spent most of the day in our vans waiting for the rain to stop. However, the weather didn't seem to change at all. The forecast also looked quite bad, so we drove about 200km down south to lake [Untrafjarden](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Untrafjarden/) where we expected the weather to be better.

The rain was gone after spending one night at Untrafjarden. However, the whole lake was still covered in fog that didn't seem to disappear.

![Fog at Untrafjarden](/assets/images/IMG_0109.jpg)

The fog was supposed to clear at the coast a little south of lake Untrafjarden, so we drove east headed to the Baltic Sea where we eventually spotted the sun lightning up the colorful forest.

I was finally able to charge my batteries again while we enjoyed a sunbath in our camping chairs. :sunny:

After cruising around the area we ended up staying at lake Vällen west of [Kolarmora](https://www.google.com/maps/place/740+12+Kolarmora,+Sweden/).

![Vans parked near lake Vällen](/assets/images/IMG_0139_2.jpg)

The weather for the upcoming day was supposed the be sunny. Unfortunately, the forecast turned out to be wrong and we spent another day covered in fog.

![Lake Vällen covered in fog](/assets/images/IMG_0138.jpg)

On our run from the fog headed south, we reached [Stockholm](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Stockholm,+Sweden/). As usual, we didn't feel like staying in urban areas and only passed Sweden's capital city. After spending several weeks on lonely roads, all the blinking billboards and the traffic seemed quite chaotic. :wink:

![Traffic in Stockholm](/assets/images/IMG_0146.jpg)

Things seemed much more relaxed at [Sörsjön](https://www.google.com/maps/place/S%C3%B6rsj%C3%B6n/), a small lake south of Stockholm where we found a natural spring to full up our water tanks.

## Enjoying the last day together with Moritz

The clouds and the fog finally cleared when we approached [Vättern](https://www.google.com/maps/place/V%C3%A4ttern/).

![Sunset above the highway](/assets/images/IMG_0153.jpg)

The sun was already set when I arrived at Sweden's second largest lake. It wasn't dark, though. The bright moon was shining an lightened the calm water.

![Moon above Vättern](/assets/images/IMG_0157.jpg)

When the sun rose, I was able to sense the size of the gigantic lake.

![View on Vättern in the morning](/assets/images/IMG_0161.jpg)

Moritz had some commitments at home and was about to drive to Trelleborg to take a ferry back to Germany. We enjoyed really nice weather on our last day together in Sweden.

![Great weather at Vättern](/assets/images/IMG_0197.jpg)

The sunny weather encouraged us to go for a very refreshing swim in the cold lake.

![Taking a swim in Vättern](/assets/images/IMG_0171.jpg)

It was a strange feeling when Moritz left in the afternoon. We were travel buddies for almost two months. I thought about all the great things we experienced together in the lonely woods of Sweden while watching the sunset above Vättern.

## Spending the last days in Sweden

After leaving lake Vättern, I enjoyed another sunny workday at a lake near the [Toftaholm nature reserve](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toftaholm+naturreservat/).

![Sunset at Vättern](/assets/images/IMG_0206.jpg)

The area became more populated, the further I drove toward the southern coast of Sweden. Before visiting acquaintances in [Malmö](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Malm%C3%B6,+Sweden/), I spent a night in front of a windmill close to [Lund](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lund,+Sweden/).

![Sunset at Vättern](/assets/images/IMG_0212.jpg)

After enjoying a great dinner in Malmö, I spent my last night in Sweden in a paring lot in [Trelleborg](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trelleborg,+Sweden/) where I had [started my trip through Sweden]({% post_url 2020-08-27-entering-the-swedish-woods %}) in August.

While approaching Germany with the ferry, I thought about all the unforgettable moments I experienced on my trip through Sweden.

![Sunset at Vättern](/assets/images/IMG_0220_2.jpg)

Crossing the whole country on lonely roads was a wonderful experience and I really want to come back to Scandinavia again. At the same time I was also looking forward to get back in touch with my family and friends after spending almost two months in the endless woods of Sweden. Great times!
