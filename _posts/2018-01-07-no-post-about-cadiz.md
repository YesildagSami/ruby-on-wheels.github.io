On Friday evening, I left Cádiz after spending a couple of sunny and lovely days in the Spanish harbor town. My weather app forecasted stormy and rainy weather. Nothing that I wanted to experience right at the beach front. Even the street signs warned about the upcoming wind:

I drove a little into the mainland behind a mountain. I found shelter from the strong wind next to an artificial lake called [Embalse de Barbate](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Embalse+de+Barbate/). It rained the whole night, but in the morning the sun was shining again. I wanted to find a nice and quiet spot near the coast to write a post with some of the pictures that I took in Cádiz:

## A challenging way back to the coast

The scenery on my way back to the coast was really nice. A lot of green plants, mountains and some old farms. However, the further I drove along the road, the worse it got. I took a picture of the road while it was still easy to drive

More potholes appeared over time. Sometimes these holes were more than 20cm deep. Nevertheless, I kept on driving until I reached a part of the road that was flooded.

The traces of the wheels that passed before seemed very big. Maybe tractors? :tractor: The water was too dirty to see if and where I would be able to pass with my simple van. I was in the middle of nowhere. I didn't want to risk getting stuck there. So, I turned back to look for an alternative route.

On my way back, I was driving around a huge pothole when my van suddenly drifted to the right. The roadside completely broke apart and pulled my van off the road. I tried to stabilize the ground with a bunch of stones and big branches. It was pointless. As soon as I tried to move the van, the ground broke even more and the van turned dangerously to the side.

It was obvious that I needed another vehicle to pull my van out of that misery.

I picked the best place and date for my adventure. :innocent: I was in the middle of nowhere and it was Epiphany, a federal holiday on which Spanish families get together and give presents to each other. There was no farmer around that could pull out my van with a tractor.

I couldn't find any help locally. So, I called my insurance and ended up waiting the whole afternoon for a tow truck. The weather was nice at least and there were a lot of interesting birds and other animals to observe. Apparently, I got stuck near [Corredor Verde Dos Bahías](http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/medioambiente/corredorVerde/mostrarFicha.do?idCorredor=31). A hiking trail that is the home for many protected animals and plants. :bird: :rabbit2: :seedling:

## Bringing the van back on the road

The sun was already set when the tow truck arrived.

The driver was a friendly dude. We planned how to rescue my van without flipping it over. We ended up pulling the van carefully out of the mud with a hydraulic cable winch. Lucky me! :tada:

The van was back on the road and I could drive to the next village where I slept in a parking lot in a quiet side road.
