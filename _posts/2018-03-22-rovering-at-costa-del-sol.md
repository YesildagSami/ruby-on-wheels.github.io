The quiet spot located north of [Algeciras](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Algeciras,+CÃ¡diz,+Spain/) was perfect for recovering from my exhausting [trip back to Europe]({% post_url 2018-03-20-coming-back-to-europe %}). We had nice view on the [Rock of Gibraltar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rock+of+Gibraltar/) and the Riff mountain chain in Africa.

The [Mercedes gang]({% post_url 2018-02-04-hanging-out-with-the-mercedes-gang %}) was united again and gained new members with Julia and Ruben who had already spent a week with their Mercedes Sprinter at this lovely spot.

I joined the others during my breaks from work. We got along pretty well and there were always interesting things to talk about. We spent most of the evenings together. Either in Stefan's spacious van or at a warming campfire.

After spending a very pleasant work week in great company, I feel ready to continue my trip towards [Madrid]({% post_url 2017-10-29-van-life-in-a-big-city %}). :es:
