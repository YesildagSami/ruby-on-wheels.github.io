Morocco is one of the most diverse country that I've visited. Crossing the Atlas mountain range was impressive. I experienced summer, fall, winter and spring within a couple of days on a trip that was only about 300km.

After enjoying temperatures around 29 degrees Celsius (84 Fahrenheit) with [Said]({% post_url 2018-03-14-meeting-said %}) near [Errachidia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Errachidia/), I drove over the eastern High Atlas and stayed in the desert a few kilometers in front of [Midelt](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Midelt/).

I had a nice view on the High Atlas covered in snow. It was still very warm during the day but noticeable colder at night. The more I drove north, the more clouds covered the sky.

The temperature dropped and it rained a lot while I was driving through the Middle Atlas. The climate changed and so did the vegetation. It had been a long time since I saw green grass and trees. The scenery reminded me of the fall in Germany.

It was around 0 degrees Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) when I woke up in [Ifrane](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ifran/) which is about 1,700 meters above sea level. I couldn't hear the rain dropping on my van anymore. Did the weather get better? Not all! When I looked out of my window, I saw snow falling down the sky. :snowflake:

My first winter experience in 2018. Enough for me. It was about time to leave the Middle Atlas!

Only 50km further down the way towards [Fes](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fes/), the temperatures went up again.

Everything was green and flowers were blooming next to the road. It was springtime!

I experienced all four seasons on my way from Midelt to a beautiful reservoir near [Ain Dorij](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ain+Dorij/).

Wow, what an impressive route!
