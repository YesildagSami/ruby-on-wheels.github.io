After spending a couple of [days in the snow]({% post_url 2020-12-16-welcoming-the-german-winter %}), I swiftly crossed the French border headed toward Spain. The weather looked much better when I passed [Dole](https://www.google.com/maps/place/39100+Dole,+France/) in the morning: blue sky, sun shine and lush meadows.

Attracted by the warm weather in the south, I spent all day driving until I reached the Mediterranean Sea in the afternoon.

After resting and eating a little bit, I still felt energized to drive the remaining 200km to Spain.

## Arriving in Spain

It was already dark when I finally crossed the Spanish border. I spent the night near [Girona](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Girona,+Spain/) and continued my journey in the morning. The engine of my van was quite busy when crossing the [Catalan Pre-Coastal Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Pre-Coastal_Range) with 55km/h.

After spending most of the weekend on the road, I reached Madrid where I stayed for a couple of days to work and meet some of my friends living in the Spanish capital. As usual, I stayed in the area of [Casa de Campo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Casa+de+Campo,+Madrid,+Spain/).

I left Madrid before Christmas and drove into the area of [Belvís de Monroy](https://www.google.com/maps/place/10394+Belv%C3%ADs+de+Monroy,+C%C3%A1ceres,+Spain/) where I worked in a quiet environment.

I still had to run my wood stove in the evenings to keep the van warm, so I continued my trip toward the warmer south.

The weather was much warmer when I reached the [province of Huelva](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Huelva,+Spain/@37.501411,-7.3826518,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd11bec5f4b28889:0x30463fd8c9fca80!8m2!3d37.6060122!4d-6.9209135). I was finally able to work with open doors while staying at [Embalse de Zufre](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Embalse+de+Zufre/).

## A spontaneous trip to Tarifa

I was planning to spend the Christmas holidays in the mountains before taking a ferry from Huelva to [Lanzarote](https://www.google.com/maps/place/35340+Lanzarote,+Las+Palmas,+Spain/). My plans quickly changed when a friend of mine invited me to join him and a few other vandwellers to celebrate Christmas on a beach near [Tarifa](https://www.google.com/maps/place/11380+Tarifa,+C%C3%A1diz,+Spain/). I accepted the detour and drove down to [Duna De Valdevaqueros](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Duna+De+Valdevaqueros/).

We enjoyed a lovely Christmas dinner on [Playa Valdevaqueros](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+Valdevaqueros/).

After spending a couple of days with my friend and the others, I drove back to the harbor of Huelva.

I spent my last night on the mainland near [Parque botánico José Celestino Mutis](https://www.google.com/maps/place/bot%C3%A1nico+Jos%C3%A9+Celestino+Mutis+Park/) before boarding the ferry to Lanzarote. :ship: :sunny:
