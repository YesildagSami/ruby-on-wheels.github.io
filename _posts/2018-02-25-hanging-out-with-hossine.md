I left the [hot spring](({% post_url 2018-02-23-taking-a-hot-bath-in-the-dessert %})) on Saturday morning to hang out with [Hossine]({% post_url 2018-02-19-exploring-the-mountains %}) again. We met up with his cousin in [Guelmim](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Guelmim+81000,+Morocco/) to visit the [souk](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Souk+Amhirich/), a traditional market. I was looking for a hoody made out of sheep's wool. These jackets are harder to find in the south than in the north where they are produced. Nevertheless, we were able to score a fitting hoody for a good price with Hossine's help.

I really enjoyed strolling around the city with Hossine and his cousin. We visited one of their friends at a shop where we spent a typical Moroccan afternoon: relaxing, talking and of course drinking tea.

Tea drinking is a big tradition in Morocco. I didn't only like the good taste, but the whole ceremony. After enjoying a couple of teas, I decided to get a Moroccan tea set for my van.

Observing Hossine's conversations with the sellers was really interesting. They were a mix of consulting, negotiating and small talk. In Germany, I would have probably entered a shop, asked for teapots, compared three pots and bought one of them. Five minutes. Done! In Morocco, we spent about an hour comparing different teapots and talking to different sellers. We weren't in a rush, so there was plenty of time to socialize. I liked it. The situation reminded me of a quote:

> Europeans have the clock, Africans have the time.

## Another night in Hossine's village

We drove back to [Hossine's village](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Abaynou,+Morocco/) where we met with another friend on a little hill to watch the sunset. They usually meet there every evening to relax, talk and of course, to drink tea! :wink:

Our great night ended in my van where I was taught how to prepare a Saharan tea.

Pouring the freshly brewed tea from one glass into another several times, produces a foam which will keep the sand out of the tea. A valuable lesson for my upcoming trip into the windy dessert! Thanks Hossine for your hospitality! I gained a new friend that I will hopefully see again, soon!
