[Chefchaouen](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chefchaouen,+Morocco/) was my last stop before driving to the harbor of [Tangier](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tangier,+Morocco/) city. Located in the Riff mountains, Chefchaouen is known for its blue buildings.

Almost every house in the Medina is painted in blue which creates a very special atmosphere.

I could tell that the region around Chefchaouen was one of the main producers of cannabis in Morocco. Several dealers tried to sell hash or invited me to their Cannabis farms while I was strolling through the blue alleys.

## Bad weather

I'd have loved to spend more time exploring Chefchaouen and the Riff mountains. However, the weather was really bad. One of my windows started leaking after hours of heavy rain and strong wind. Some of the streets were already turning into little rivers.

The forecast didn't look promising, either. I decided to leave Chefchaouen early Sunday morning. The mountain scenery on my rainy way to Tangier was really green. So different to what I saw in the south!

## No ferries to Europe

When I arrived at the harbor, I had to realize that all ferries from Tangier city to Spain were canceled because of the bad weather. I was told to drive to [Tanger-Med](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tanger+Med+Port+Authority/), a cargo port located about an hour away from Tangier city. However, there was even more chaos in Tanger-Med. Some ferries were sold out, some were delayed and others were canceled. The people at the checkin weren't very helpful, either. They closed the office most of the time. Once in awhile, they'd open the counter to tell me that I'd have to wait for the next ferry.

I could already see the European continent on the other side of the Strait of Gibraltar.

So close, but not reachable! At the end of the day, I still couldn't get a ticket and decided to get some sleep. I slept at better spots in Morocco. :wink:

## Coming back to Europe

I finally boarded a ferry after spending 24 hours in the harbor. The weather turned way better as soon as we approached the Spanish coast.

I was back on European ground after spending more than two months in Morocco. A totally different world. Although I was still far away from my home country, I felt like coming back to a familiar place. Back to Spain, a country that seemed so different more than half a year ago when coming from Germany. :wink:

I was really exhausted. Luckily, Robert and Stefan were parked very close at a quite spot near [Algeciras](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Algeciras,+CÃ¡diz,+Spain/).

The perfect spot to calm down and process all the impressions from my amazing trip through northern Africa.
