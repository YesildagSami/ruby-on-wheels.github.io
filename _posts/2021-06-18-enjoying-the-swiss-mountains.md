I didn't spend a lot of time in France after [crossing the Pyrenees]({% post_url 2021-06-13-crossing-the-pyrenees %}) because I wanted to visit my friend Martin in Switzerland. We met a year ago when I [visited Switzerland]({% post_url 2020-07-31-visiting-switzerland %}) and spent some time together in [Tarifa]({% post_url 2020-12-30-celebrating-christmas-on-the-beach %}) and the [Canary Islands]({% post_url 2021-03-16-starting-the-new-year-on-the-canary-islands %}).

We reunited at near [Isleten](https://www.google.com/maps/place/6461+Isleten,+Switzerland/) and took a swim at [Vierwaldstättersee](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lake+Lucerne/). While the air was quite warm, the water was freezing cold as the rivers carried all the melting ice from the mountains into the valley.

We left the crowded area around the lake and settled a little further up the mountains where it was more relaxed.

The weather was amazing during the weekend, so I grabbed my mountain-bike for a day trip around [Klewenalp](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Klewenalp,+6375+Beckenried,+Switzerland). I parked my van in [Beckenried](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Beckenried,+Switzerland) and cycled up Klewenalp on the north-west side.

On the top there was a take-off zone for paragliders that provided a nice view on Vierwaldstättersee.

After reaching the summit, I surrounded the Klewenalp and took some trails down to the lake on the east side.

The ride was so much fun and there were plenty more mountains around the lake, so I went on another trip the next day. I picked a shorter route that I could tackle after work in the evening and cycled up to [Bürgenstock](https://www.google.com/maps/place/B%C3%BCrgenstock).

The views were amazing!

What a beautiful area. It seemed like a true paradise for outdoor enthusiasts!
