The freezing temperatures forced me to paused my work on the [shower cabin]({% post_url 2019-01-05-building-the-shower-cabin %}), so I continued covering the insulated walls with wood.

## Preparing the panels

The original panels didn't feel very smooth. I also didn't like the vertical scratches caused by the factory's belt sander.

I sanded the panels until I was satisfied with the look and feel.

To protect the wood from dirt and humidity, I finished the panels with a [natural wood wax](https://www.amazon.de/OSMO-Osmo-Color-Dekorwachs-transp-750/dp/B002ABTN64?tag=mumothhoofba-21). Although the sun warmed up the barn a little bit, it took quite a long time until the wood completely soaked up the oil and wax.

## Mounting the panels

While the wax was slowly drying in the cold, I built two decorative wooden strips that perfectly covered a plastic strip meant to hold and connect two panels.

I screwed the plastic strip into the [wooden scaffold in the walls]({% post_url 2018-10-21-building-a-wooden-scafold %}),

and covered the ugly white plastic with the wooden strip.

I liked the result much better than a visible joint and a bunch of screws preventing the two panels from curving.

I'm happy with the outcome. I should be able to fit the panels for the ceiling, soon. :soon:
