I left the peaceful [spot behind the dunes]({% post_url 2018-01-26-working-behind-the-dunes %}) on Saturday morning and followed the coastal road. The tiny road invited me to gently cruise along the coast with a relaxed speed of 60km/h. :sunglasses:

A young boy riding a donkey was the only one I met on that road. When passing him, I interpreted his hand pointing to his mouth as "I'm thirsty. Do you have something to drink?" He was obviously surprised when I stopped to offer him a cup of water through my window. We had a quick chat about the vegetables loaded on his donkey and all the tajines his family would make out of it. Funny encounter.

I stopped several times to enjoy the beautiful views over dry and rocky hills in front of the beaches.

## Arriving in Imsouane

I passed [Tilit](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tilit,+Morocco/) when I followed the coastal road P1000. The road brought me further to [Imsouane](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Imsouane,+Morocco/), a little fisher village that became very popular among surfers.

I was told that the village has grown a lot since the last ten years. Some old houses at the beach front looked like they might have been built before the surf shops and hostels opened up in the back of the harbor.

There was a cozy campsite right next to the village. It was about time to do my laundry. So, I decided to stay there.

## Exploring the coast north of Imsouane

Unfortunately, the conditions were not great for surfing on Saturday. So, I explored the coast north of Imsouane instead of playing in the water.

The wind was too strong for surfing and pushed up the waves hitting the coast. Beautiful!

On my way back, the setting sun provided a breath taking, colorful view over Imsouane.

## Riding endless waves

The wind calmed down on Sunday. I could finally go surfing. The bay in front of the harbor created veeeery long waves that were relatively easy to ride. It was possible to surf more than 600 meters when catching the right wave. I admittedly didn't make it all the way through. But I saw a local boy who actually made it. Awesome! :surfer:

Once I reached the beach, I could simply walk along the coast to the harbor. Protected by the wall of the harbor, it was very easy to get back out into the waves. The blue arrow in the screenshot of Google Maps indicates the relaxed walk from the beach back into the waves. The white ruler measures a distance of 640 meters that can potentially be surfed. Almost endless! :wink:

So much fun! Although I was able to save a lot of energy with that technique, I was quite exhausted after surfing most of the day!
