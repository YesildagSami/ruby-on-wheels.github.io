I've been working on and living in my Mercedes 508D for about two and a half years. I documented the [building process]({% post_url 2018-09-05-moving-into-an-old-military-ambulance %}) and all the [maintenance]({% post_url 2019-11-28-maintaining-my-van %}) [work]({% post_url 2020-06-11-rebuilding-the-brake-system %}) but I've never presented the van as a whole, so here we go:

![Mercedes 508D](/assets/images/IMG_9841.jpg)

My Mercedes 508D was built in 1986 and equipped with the OM314 3.8 liter diesel truck engine. The former military ambulance truck is 5.1m long, 2.1m wide and 2.9m high. I really like the dimensions because I can stand inside, lay down crossways and park the van in any regular parking lot.

When I bought the van in 2018, I [ripped out all the interior]({% post_url 2018-09-05-moving-into-an-old-military-ambulance %}#taking-the-van-apart) and started transforming the ambulance into a wooden camper equipped with solar panels, WiFi, a [kitchen]({% post_url 2019-04-16-building-the-kitchen %}), a [shower]({% post_url 2019-03-19-laminating-the-shower %}), a [warm water system]({% post_url 2019-04-17-installing-the-water-system %}), a [wood stove]({% post_url 2019-12-02-installing-a-wood-stove %}), a [seating area]({% post_url 2019-03-04-building-a-scaffold-for-the-seating-area %}) with a table, a [permanent and extensible bed]({% post_url 2019-04-12-building-the-bed %}) and a lot of [storage]({% post_url 2020-01-04-building-storage-furnitures %}).

## The kitchen

The [kitchen]({% post_url 2019-04-16-building-the-kitchen %}) is divided into two areas: a small foldable table right next to the side-door for the [electric cooker]({% post_url 2018-09-18-testing-my-new-equipment %}#electric-cooker),

and a countertop with a [sink]({% post_url 2019-04-17-installing-the-water-system %}), [cupboards and shelves]({% post_url 2020-01-04-building-storage-furnitures %}).

Below the cupboard for the pans, pots and dishes, there is a drawer holding a 46 liter [compressor cooler and freezer]({% post_url 2018-09-18-testing-my-new-equipment %}#fridge).

## The shower

The [laminated]({% post_url 2019-03-19-laminating-the-shower %}) [shower]({% post_url 2018-11-19-building-the-shower-frame %}) is right in front of the countertop. The shower cabin is equipped with three ventilators and connected to a [diesel heater]({% post_url 2018-10-05-resisting-colder-temperatures %}), so it can also be used as a drying room.

## The office, living and bed room

When leaving the shower, you stand right in front of the [seating area]({% post_url 2019-03-04-building-a-scaffold-for-the-seating-area %}) that consists of a U-shaped bench and a table that comfortably fits five people.

The benches on the sides offer a lot of space to relax.

The part in the very back of the seating area measures 0.7m by 1.9m and serves as a permanent bed that is ideal for short naps during the day. The adjustable table can be lowered to transform the whole seating area into a huge bed that measures 1.65m by 1.9m.

## The garage

I use the space below the seating area to store all my tools, spare parts and mountain bike.

![Storage below the bed](/assets/images/IMG_6882.jpg)

The mountain bike is stored on a [pull-out rack]({% post_url 2019-03-07-building-a-pull-out-bike-rack %}) which makes it easy to access.

## Nice add-ons

I've kept the hooks for the hammock in which I slept during the [early days of the building process]({% post_url 2018-09-05-moving-into-an-old-military-ambulance %}). I still enjoy lying in the hammock to enjoy the views.

The [wood stove]({% post_url 2019-12-02-installing-a-wood-stove %}) is my most favorite part of the van. The little stove has turned out to be very useful while staying in cold areas like [Scandinavia]({% post_url 2020-09-15-watching-the-northern-sky %}).

I also use the wood stove for cooking when I stay in areas where the sun does not provide enough power for my electric cooker.
