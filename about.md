:wave: Iâ€™m Jakob, a German software engineer. I live in a [self-converted camper van]({% post_url 2020-11-26-presenting-my-mercedes-508d %}) and [work remotely]({% post_url 2017-10-21-working-productively-in-a-van %}) for [GitHub](https://github.com/). On this website, I write about my experiences building, maintaining, living and working out of a camper van.

At GitHub we use [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), a web application framework written in the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) programming language. As I work on Ruby projects from my van that has wheels, I thought it'd be funny to replace *Rails* with *Wheels* for the title of this blog. :thinking:

In early 2017, I [bought]({% post_url 2017-02-04-the-first-ride %}) an old [Mercedes-Benz 209D camper]({% post_url 2017-01-11-my-future-mobile-office %}), [ordered a solar system]({% post_url 2017-03-06-ordering-my-solar-system %}), [turned the camper into a mobile office]({% post_url 2017-05-06-turning-my-van-into-a-mobile-office %}) and [learned how to fix it]({% post_url 2017-05-18-a-crash-course-on-mechanics %}). After traveling with the Mercedes 209D for more than a year through Europe and Northern Africa, I sold it in June 2018 to [rebuild an old military ambulance]({% post_url 2018-09-05-moving-into-an-old-military-ambulance %}) truck which became my new [mobile home and office]({% post_url 2017-10-21-working-productively-in-a-van %}).

Since I left my apartment and [hit the road]({% post_url 2017-05-11-leaving-berlin %}) on May 11th, 2017, I came across many places in several countries:
